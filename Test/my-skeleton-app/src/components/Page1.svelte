    <h3>About the Project</h3>
    <p>Driverbot, or Boberbot as I like to call it, is a project where we built a remote-controlled car that can be controlled via a website using a broker. The car controlled by this website is equipped with a sensor to prevent you from backing into objects. It also has a recording function where you can press the R button to start recording and then input a series of commands in any order. After pressing the R button again, the car will repeat the commands you wanted it to do without you needing to touch the computer! Pretty cool, right? Otherwise, the car is controlled using the W, A, S, and D keys. Enjoy!</p>
